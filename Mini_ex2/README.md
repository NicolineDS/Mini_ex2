In my Mini_ex2 I have used very simple and basic shapes and syntaxes to create a game where the player needs to move the blue ellipse through a maze and to the end goal. When the ellipse touches the word “goal” the word will start spinning around as a reward for completing the game. I have used some coding I never have tried before which is “If-codes” and a code to get the ellipse to follow the mouse. It was a lot of fun to try out new types of coding but also difficult and a bit confusing. One of the instructors helped me create the “If-codes” because I did not know how to make the word “goal” spin around and the colour of the rectangles to change when touched by the mouse. And even though she explained how she made the code I still found it confusing. I ended up using the “if-code” a lot and I got a better understanding of it after having used it a couple of times.
I believe the definition and the meaning of fun is different from person to person and just as Oga Goriunova says in her text ‘Exploring Pleasure, Paradox and Pain in Computing;’   “Fun should not be understood correctly or in one way its strength is multiplicity.” 
This is the reason why I have made a game, because I find games and challenges funny and entertaining. I do no expect others to enjoy the game as much as I do because they might finf it boring or they just do not like playing games. But that is okay because I enjoyed making it and I find it amusing to play with.
